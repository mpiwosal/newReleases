# NewReleases

NewReleases is an iOS app written in Swift 4.2. The Goal of the app is to show users new releases by artists they are following on Spotify. For me Radar Premier is very unreliable (shows stuff I'm not interested in and doesn't show new releases from artists I follow) and notifications about new releases don't work at all ðŸ¤·. That's why I decided to make this app. Could be later expanded to support other streaming services.

*It is very early in development. Version 0.01.
